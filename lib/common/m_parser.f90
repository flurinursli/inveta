MODULE m_parser

  ! Purpose:
  !   To provide routines to parse generic sequential ASCII files, including input and miniseed files. A line of a generic input
  !   file can contain a keyword followed by one or more fields, each introducing a one or multiple strings, integers or real numbers,
  !   and must end with a comma, e.g.:
  !
  !     KEY field_a = 48.2, field_b = {4,2,5}, field_c = {1.,3.; 5.,-2.3; 7.3, 4.5}, field_d = 'any possible string',
  !
  !   To parse each field in such a line, one would open the file and then use:
  !
  !     parse(scalar_real, file_unit, 'field_a', ['=', ','], key = 'KEY')
  !     parse(vector_integer, file_unit, 'field_b', ['{', '}'], key = 'KEY', elm = ',')
  !     parse(matrix_real, file_unit, 'field_c', ['{', '}'], key = 'KEY', elm = ',', grp = ';')
  !     parse(string, file_unit, ["'", "'"], key = 'KEY')
  !
  !   Lines may be commented out, e.g.:
  !
  !     # KEY field_a = 48.2, [...]
  !
  !   In this case the command
  !
  !     parse(scalar_real, file_unit, 'field_a', ['=', ','], com = '#')
  !
  !   allows to skip commented lines. In general, a file may contain the same key more than once:
  !
  !     KEY field_a = 48.2, field_b = {4,2,5}, field_c = {1.,3.; 5.,-2.3; 7.3, 4.5}, field_d = 'any possible string',
  !     KEY field_a = 48.2, field_b = {4,2,5}, field_c = {1.,3.; 5.,-2.3; 7.3, 4.5}, field_d = 'any possible string',
  !
  !   In this case, one can read fields introduced by the a specific key-number, e.g.:
  !
  !     parse(scalar_real, file_unit, 'field_a', ['=', ','], key = 'KEY', nkey = 2)
  !
  !   A key may introduce more than a single field of the same kind, but these must occur on different (continued) lines, e.g.:
  !
  !     KEY field_d = 'string 1', field_a = 48.2, +
  !         field_d = 'string 2', field_a = 31.8, +
  !         field_d = 'string 3', field_a = 7.1,
  !
  !   Under these circumstances, one must indicate also the field number. For instance:
  !
  !     parse(scalar_real, file_unit, 'field_a', ['=', ','], key = KEY, nfield = 3)
  !
  !   would lead to scalar_real = 7.1.
  !   Note that the line continuation symbol is handled automatically but, since it is hard-coded, must be changed (if necessary)
  !   before compiling the module (see parameter "cont" below). Also, a single field cannot be expanded into two or more lines.
  !
  !   Parsing routines can handle single- and double-precision real numbers.

    FUNCTION position(buffer, marker, del, rev)

      ! Purpose:
      !   if delimiter "del" is not given, it returns the index of first and last letter of word "marker" inside "buffer". Word means
      !   that "marker" is recognized as a string if preceded only by void, comma or tab and followed by void, equal and tab. If "del"
      !   is specified, it returns the index of the first and last letter of the string introduced by "marker" and delimited by the
      !   characters in "del". If "rev" is set to true, it is expected that "marker" follows the string of interest: also, in this
      !   case, "marker" is considered as single word if followed only by void, comma or tab and preceeded by void, equal and tab.
      !   Indices are set to zero if nothing is found.
      !
      !   Examples:
      !     buffer = "f1 = 20.3, f2 = -5.2, f3 = 3.97", marker = "f2", del = ["=", ","], returns [16, 20]
      !     buffer = "20.3 f1, -5.2 f2, 3.97 f3", marker = "f2", del = [" ", ","], rev = .true., returns [9, 13]
